intel.xdk.audio
===============

For recording sounds with the microphone and playing them back.

Description
-----------

The audio object provides methods to control the recording and playback of audio
files. The audio object contains a list of audio recordings known as the
"recording list". The recording list is where new recordings are placed once
they are created.

Recordings may be created from the device's native microphone and added to the
recording list with the [startRecording](#startrecording),
[stopRecording](#stoprecording), [pauseRecording](#pauserecording), and
[continueRecording](#continuerecording) methods. An existing sound file may be
blended into a recording using [addSound](#addsound).

All the recordings on the list may be listed in an array using
[getRecordingList](#getrecordinglist), and a reference to a particular recording
for use in an application can be obtained with the
[getRecordingURL](#gerecordingurl) method.

A recording can be played back with the [startPlaying](#startplaying),
[stopPlaying](#stopplaying), [pausePlaying](#pauseplaying), and
[continuePlaying](#continueplaying) methods.

Individual recordings may be removed
from the list with [deleteRecording](#deleterecording), or the recording list
may be wiped clear using [clearRecordings](#clearrecordings). Finally, files in
the picture list may be referenced for use in an application with

Methods
-------

### addSound

Blend a pre-existing sound file into an in-progress recording.

```javascript
intel.xdk.audio.addSound(soundFile);
```

#### Description

This method is called while a recording (started by
[startRecording](#startrecording)) is in progress. It takes an existing sound
file (not a recording sound file), and overlays the sound it contains on top of
the current portion of the recording. 

(Actually, `addSound` just records the current time in the recording and the
name of the added sound file; the blending is done in a post-processing step
when the recording is complete.)

If no recording is currently in progress, then this method has no effect.

#### Available Platforms

-   Apple iOS
-   Google Android
-   Microsoft Windows 8 - BETA
-   Microsoft Windows Phone 8 - BETA
